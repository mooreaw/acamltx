"A central goal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is to significantly reduce the number of uninsured by providing a continuum of affordable coverage options through Medicaid and the Health Insurance Marketplaces. The ACA expands Medicaid coverage for most low-income adults to 138% of the federal poverty level (FPL); see this [table](http://kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-income-eligibility-limits-for-adults-at-application-2014/) for state by state Medicaid income eligibility levels for adults."
""
"*Current Status of Medicaid Expansion Decision*: Following the June 2012 Supreme Court decision, states face a decision about whether to adopt the Medicaid expansion. States' decisions about the Medicaid expansion as of April 27, 2018. For more information, see: [Status of State Action on the Medicaid Expansion Decision](http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-activity-around-expanding-medicaid-under-the-affordable-care-act/). It is important to note that per CMS guidance, there is no deadline for states to implement the Medicaid expansion."

"Current status on the Medicaid expansion decision for each state is based on KFF tracking and analysis of state executive activity."

"Definitions"
"*Health Insurance Marketplace Types*:"
""
"*State-based Marketplace*: States running a State-based Marketplace are responsible for performing all Marketplace functions for both the individual market and the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP). Consumers as well as small employers and their employees in these states apply for and enroll in coverage through Marketplace websites established and maintained by the states."
""
"*State-based Marketplace-Federal Platform*: States with this type of Marketplace are considered to have a State-based Marketplace, and are responsible for performing all Marketplace functions for the individual market and the SHOP, except that the state will rely on the Federally-facilitated Marketplace IT platform. Consumers as well as small employers and their employees in these states apply for and enroll in coverage through healthcare.gov."
""
"*State-Partnership Marketplace* States entering into a Partnership Marketplace conduct plan management and may administer in-person consumer assistance; HHS performs the remaining Marketplace functions. Consumers as well as small employers and their employees in states with a Partnership Marketplace apply for and enroll in coverage through healthcare.gov."
""
"*Federally-facilitated Marketplace*: In a Federally-facilitated Marketplace, HHS performs all Marketplace functions. Consumers as well as small employers and their employees in states with a Federally-facilitated Marketplace apply for and enroll in coverage through healthcare.gov."


Footnotes
"1. Coverage under the Medicaid expansion became effective January 1, 2014 in all states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion except for the following: Michigan (4/1/2014), New Hampshire (8/15/2014), Pennsylvania (1/1/2015), Indiana (2/1/2015), Alaska (9/1/2015), Montana (1/1/2016), Louisiana (7/1/2016), and Maine (to be determined)."
"2. Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, and New Hampshire have approved Section 1115 waivers for the Medicaid expansion."
"3. Arkansas and New Mexico have established state-administered websites for the SHOP marketplace. Small employers and their employees apply for coverage through these state websites, not healthcare.gov."
"4. Expansion proponents in Idaho and Nebraska are collecting signatures to place expansion measures on the November ballots in their states. Signatures are due by May 1, 2018 in Idaho and July 6, 2018 in Nebraska."
"5. Kansas, Maine, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Virginia have received approval from HHS to conduct plan management activities to support certification of qualified health plans in the Federally-facilitated Marketplace."
"6. Kentucky initially adopted expansion through a state plan amendment but received CMS approval for the Kentucky HEALTH expansion waiver on January 12, 2018; implementation of some provisions was scheduled to start in April 2018 and full implementation is expected by July 2018."
"7. Maine adopted the Medicaid expansion through a ballot initiative in November 2017 and the ballot measure requires submission of a state plan amendment (SPA) within 90 days and implementation of expansion within 180 days of the measure’s effective date; however, the Governor failed to meet the SPA submission deadline (April 3, 2018)."
"8. Mississippi and Utah operate the SHOP marketplace; the federal government operates the individual marketplace in these states."
"9. Expansion supporters in Montana are collecting signatures to place a measure on the November ballot that would eliminate the state's June 2019 expansion program sunset date and raise tobacco taxes to fund the state's share of expansion costs."
"10. The Utah Legislature passed and Governor Herbert signed a bill on March 27, 2018 directing the state to seek federal approval to expand Medicaid to 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) using the ACA enhanced federal match rate and add a work requirement for the expansion population. To date, CMS has not approved waivers to access the enhanced match rate unless a state implements the expansion to 138% FPL. In addition, Utah voters will vote on a measure on the November ballot that would fully expand Medicaid to 138% FPL."
"11. The Virginia House of Delegates voted 69-31 on February 22, 2018 to approve a budget proposal that would have the state adopt the ACA Medicaid expansion as well as institute a work requirement for many Medicaid enrollees. The Virginia Senate’s budget proposal does not include Medicaid expansion. The final budget must get a majority vote in each house. The regular legislative session ended in early March and Governor Northam called a special session beginning on April 11th to resolve the expansion dispute and finalize the budget."
"12. Wisconsin covers adults up to 100% FPL in Medicaid but did not adopt the ACA expansion."
